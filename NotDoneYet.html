<p> At the age of 16 I committed to continue my academic and athletic career
  at the University of Miami. Despite all the setbacks I had faced over my
  life I knew I wasn't done yet.</p>

<h2>Moments</h2>
<p> One moment I will forever cherrish at the University of Miami is my
  overtime goal at the University of Florida. That was the first time in school
  hisotry that we beat UF in overtime. Also, it was a couple of years since we
  had beat UF on their home turf. That is a moment in my career I will never
  forget. The highlight of that moment was the dogpile and the rush of
  adrenaline I got because I had made an impact. Till this day I replay that
  goal over and over again.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p> I don't know what exactly the future holds but I am optimistic. I want to
  continue to play soccer at the professional level. Whether that be overseas
  or in the United States. If that doesn't work out I will want to be a
  broadcaster at a major company. All of this will come after me graduating in
  the Fall of 2022 with a bachelors in Broadcast Journalism with minors in
  marketing and sports adminstration.
  Stay tuned to see where you see me next!</p>
