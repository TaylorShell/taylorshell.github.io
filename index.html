<h1>Taylor Shell: Background Information</h1>
<body>
  <p> My name is Taylor Shell. I was born in Manhattan, New York but was raised
    in Richmond, Virginia. Growing up I was one of the most active kids. I
    tried every sport from t-ball, to dance, to basketball, and to soccer.
    Soccer was the sport that I fell in love with first. At the age of three
    my mom signed me up on the YMCA youth soccer team. I was the smallest one
    on my team. My shingurads looked like cinderblocks around my calves and
    my jersey was so long it could touch my toes. That didn't stop me from
    being one of the most energetic people on the field.</p>

    <p> At the age of eight I made my first travel team. Once I joined I knew
      I wanted to play soccer forever. Around the age of 13, I knew I could
      see a future at the collegiate level. After months of working my tail off
      I was given the opportunity to attend the University of Texas at the
      age of 14.</p>

      <p> At 16, I made the biggest decision on my life and committed to
        continue my athletic and academic career at the University of Miami.
        All the missed school dances, private lessons, and going out to
        work on my craft when everyone was taking a break was
        well worth it. I know get to live out my dream and I would never
      change a thing.</p>
