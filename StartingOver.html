  <h1> Who is Taylor Shell...</h1>
  <h2> The Injury </h1>
  <p> My sophmore year of highschool would be one of the hardest years
    of my life. I waw used to facing adversity but think was a different animal.
    On April 2nd I tore my ACL. Otherwise known as your Anterior Cruciate
    Ligament. I was in shock when I heard the results. My first initial thought
    was my soccer career was over. From that moment I was reliving the acitons
    leading up to the event. Whether I could have done something different.
    I was told I can only control what I can control. I looked at the Injury
    as a time reset the clock and work on myself.</p>

    <h2>Rehab</h2>
<p> After realizing my soccer career was coming to a pause I knew I had to
  focus on getting back to the person I was. The catch was getting stronger
  because my injury resulted in a area I was lacking. Early mornings at 6 A.M.
  I would go to my first session than come back in the afternoon to continue
  my rehab. Grinding day in and day out to get back playing the game I love.
  After a long eight months of gruiling rehab I was able to get back on the
  field.</p>

    <h2>First Day Back</h2>
<p> My first day back on the field I was nervous but it was a good nervous. I
  waited so long to get back on the field. My first touch on the ball I
  assisted my teammate for her first ever goal. My second touch of the ball I
  scored a goal. I was ambushed by my teammates. I was overwhelmed with joy
  because I knew I was back. I was at a lost of words.
  After the game I was so close to breaking down in tears but I was rushed <body>
    my teammates with hugs and happy cries.</p>
