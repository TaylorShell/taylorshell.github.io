  <h2>Welcome!</h2>

  <p>My Name is Taylor Shell. I am 20 years old. I was born in Manhattan, New York
  but grew up in Virginia. In a small town called Midlothian.I have one older sister
  named Layla who currently attends the University of Tennesse. My favorite
  family member is my dog named Cooper. Outside of soccer I spend most of my
  days hanging out with my friends, creating many tik-toks, dabling in the
  kitchen ( I think I am a pretty good chef), and going on walks with my mom
  and dog. Many would say I'm the life of the party and can make anyone laugh.


  Follow along as to how I came became the person I am today.</p>
