  <h1> The Injury </h1>
  <p> My sophmore year of highschool would be one of the hardest years
    of my life. I waw used to facing adversity but think was a different animal.
    On April 2nd I tore my ACL. Otherwise known as your Anterior Cruciate
    Ligament. I was in shock when I heard the results. My first initial thought
    was my soccer career was over. From that moment I was reliving the acitons
    leading up to the event. Whether I could have done something different.
    I was told I can only control what I can control. I looked at the Injury
    as a time reset the clock and work on myself.</p>
