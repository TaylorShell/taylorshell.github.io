<h1> Who is Taylor Shell... </h1>

<h2>Where It All Started</h2>
Hello! My name is Taylor Shell. From the age of three I was quite active.
I played t-ball, soccer, gymanstics, etc. Nothing quite struck a cord with me
like soccer. Soccer was my everything and I didn't want to do anything else.
From that moment, I have stuck with it since.</p>

<h2>First Love</h2>
<p>Soccer was the only sport I fell in love with. I would always have a ball at
my feet 24/7. You couldnt keep away from the game. I was the smallest out there
but I was definetley the toughest. Only at about three feet tall I was
blazing through other people. As I got older I tried out for a more
competitive team.</p>

<h2>Finding My Feet</h2>
Fast forward to when I was eight I tried out for the Richmond Kickers Travel
Team. I was nervous but ready for the challenge. I eneded up making the team
where I would end up playing at that club for the next four years. At the age of
13 I tried out for the academy team. Ended up making that team and that's
where I knew I was playing with the best. Richmond United helped me
  find a college that was right for me. </p>
